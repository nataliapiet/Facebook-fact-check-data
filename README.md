# Facebook-fact-check-data

The data contains all the posts, fact-check ratings, and Facebook engagement figures obtained from from the Facebook API on October 11, 2016.

The aim of this project was to verify the reliability depending on media type (right/left-wing/mainstream) and on the source of the post.
